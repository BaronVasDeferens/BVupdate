<h3>Bunn's Village Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>No "Triple Net" Fees</b> - No hidden fees, period, and no unexpected rate fluctuations from month to month.</li>
<li><b>Private Water &amp; Sewer Systems</b> - No additional utility costs for water and sewer services-- it's already included in your monthly rate.</li>
<li><b>Flexibility</b> - Need room to exapand? No problem. Bunn's Village offers a variety of building sizes, including a number of half-units (with more on the way).  </li>
<li><b>Electricity</b> - All units feature 240V service, and over 90% are pre-wired for three-phase power. Whatever your power needs, you're covered. Service provided by McMinnville Water and Light.</li>
<li><b>Heating and Air Conditioning</b> - Both come standard on all units. All bathrooms feature hot water heaters.</li>
<li><b>Access and Convenience</b> - Plenty of off-street parking. Lots of space makes unloading easy-- even for semi trucks. Plus, all buildings feature overhead doors, each a minimum of 10'x10'.</li>
<li><b>Location</b> - Just outside of McMinnville on US Highway 99 with great visibility and access, and Neighborhood Commercial zoning means flexibility.</li>
<li><b>Appearance</b> - We are constantly updating and upgrading our buildings. A few of our buildings are essentially brand-new, featuring new exterior metal, fresh paint, and concrete floors. </li>
</ul>


<p>We require a one year minimum lease and proof of insurance. See our <a href="http://www.bunnsvillage.com/application.html">rental application</a> for more details.</p><p>
