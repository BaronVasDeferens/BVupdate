    <h3>Bunn's Village Advantages:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>No "Triple Net" Fees</b> - No hidden fees, period, and no unexpected rate fluctuations from month to
            month.
        </li>
        <li><b>Private Water &amp; Sewer Systems</b> - No additional utility costs for water and sewer services-- it's
            already included in your monthly rate.
        </li>
        <li><b>Flexibility</b> - Need room to expand? No problem. Bunn's Village offers a variety of building sizes,
            including a number of half-units (with more on the way).
        </li>
        <li><b>Electricity</b> - All units feature 240V service, and over 90% are pre-wired for three-phase power.
            Whatever your power needs, you're covered. Service provided by McMinnville Water and Light.
        </li>
        <li><b>Heating and Air Conditioning</b> - Both come standard on all units. All bathrooms feature hot water
            heaters.
        </li>
        <li><b>Access and Convenience</b> - Plenty of off-street parking. Lots of space makes unloading easy-- even for
            semi trucks. Plus, all buildings feature overhead doors, each a minimum of 10'x10'.
        </li>
        <li><b>Location</b> - Just outside of McMinnville on US Highway 99 with great visibility and access, and
            Neighborhood Commercial zoning means flexibility.
        </li>
        <li><b>Appearance</b> - We are constantly updating and upgrading our buildings. A few of our buildings are
            essentially brand-new, featuring new exterior metal, fresh paint, and concrete floors.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>We require a one year minimum lease and proof of insurance. See our <a
